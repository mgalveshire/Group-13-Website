      <h1>About Us - The College Cookbook</h1>
      <p>The College Cookbook is a food blog focused on helping college students find things to cook. We very well understand how difficult cooking can be.
      For some of us, it's our first time cooking on our own. For others, struggles come from budgeting money for ingredients or attempting to cook with 
      limited tools. That's why here at The College Cookbook we focus on creating easy to make recipes that won't break the bank!</p>
