						While the chips themselves might not be a game changer, when paired with a freshly made guacamole, 
						filled with cilantro, lime, jalapeno, and avocados, it can become an out of this world pairing.

					<td class="dishDescription">Piggybacking off of our Chips and Guacamole, we have another staple of simplicity.
						Salads are a godsend in the culinary world. They can be made from most anything, and add a nice bit of color
						to one's day! The salad we've provided uses a lot of the same ingredients as our Chips and Guacamole, so if you
						have extras, be sure to give this one a try. And don't forget to bring cheese and salad dressing if you prefer,
						salad doesn't necessarily need to be just greens.

						a snack, maybe even just dinner! Combining a soft base with delicious chocolate chips of your liking can give most other cookies a run for their
						money. Perhaps you enjoy to cut through the buttery goodness of these cookies with dark chocolate, or blissfully float away in milk chocolate dreams.
						No matter what, it's highly recommended you try this delicious recipe!
